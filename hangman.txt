- Event Loop

  - When user types a letter

    - If the letter isn't present in the list

      - Play 'Womp Womp' 
      - Decrease current_game.remaining_chances
      - If current_game.remaining_chances is 0
        - increase hangman.losses by 1
        - display "game over - press enter to start new game"
      
    - Else the letter is present in the list
   
      - If that letter has already been guessed at every occurrence
        - Print "you already guessed x" where x is the letter

      - else
         Loop through the word to find every occurrence of the letter
          - Place that letter in the corresponding locations in
            current_game.word_guessed
